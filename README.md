# ISM_Stromgren
Calculations for the ISM.  Size of Stromgren spheres, gas cooling, temperature structures. 

All distributed as-is in the form of Jupyter notebooks. 

Q1 -- Question 1.  The ionization structure of the Stromgren sphere surrounding a massive star and and AGN. 
Q2 -- Question 2.  Calculates heating rate by photoionization from the star assumed in Q1, and cooling rates by free-free, recombination, and collisions (LyA only).  Uses the above to caclulate the Temperture structure of the nebular produced by Q1. 
Q3 -- Question 3.  Calcultes the [OIII] 5007/4363 A flux ratio as a function of temperature for 4 different electron densities.  Now we have cooling from [OIII] ions as well, recalculate the Temperture structure from Q2 when metals are mixed into the ISM.
